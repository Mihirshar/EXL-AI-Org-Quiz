# Infographic Images

Place your infographic images here. The app expects the following naming convention:

```
level-{N}-a.png   → Option A infographic for Decision N
level-{N}-b.png   → Option B infographic for Decision N
```

**Note:** The display order of options is randomized each game session. The A/B labels here refer to the internal game data, not what the user sees. Images will automatically follow their corresponding choice content regardless of display order.
